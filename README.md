# Gene Expression Analysis of Whole Blood in Pediatric Septic Shock Using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Methods
Using whole blood gene expression data from children (age â‰¤10 years) within the first 24 hours of admission to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) due to septic shock, obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), a comprehensive analysis was conducted. This included differential gene expression analysis to identify significantly expressed genes between healthy controls and septic shock patients; supervised learning for classification between the two groups using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine models; unsupervised learning through clustering using K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model, HDBSCAN, and OPTICS models to group genes into specific clusters and biclustering using Spectral Biclustering to simultaneously cluster both genes and samples based on expression data; and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to explore the potential biological functions associated with genes linked to septic shock.
